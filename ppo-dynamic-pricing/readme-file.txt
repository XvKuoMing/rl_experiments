# Dynamic Pricing Optimization with PPO

This repository demonstrates a practical implementation of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for dynamic pricing optimization. The project showcases how reinforcement learning can be applied to real-world business problems like pricing strategy.

## Overview

Dynamic pricing is a strategy where businesses adjust prices based on market demand, competitor prices, and other factors to maximize revenue and profit. This project implements a PPO-based reinforcement learning solution that learns optimal pricing strategies in a simulated market environment.

## Features

- **Realistic Price Environment**: Simulates market dynamics including:
  - Price elasticity of demand
  - Competitor price influence
  - Seasonal variations
  - Random market fluctuations

- **PPO Implementation**: Complete implementation of the PPO algorithm with:
  - Actor-Critic architecture
  - Clipped surrogate objective
  - Entropy regularization
  - Value function optimization

- **Evaluation Tools**: Utilities to evaluate and visualize the performance of trained pricing agents

## Results

The trained PPO agent learns to adjust prices dynamically based on market conditions. It successfully:

1. Identifies seasonal patterns and adjusts prices accordingly
2. Responds to competitor price changes
3. Balances between short-term profits and long-term customer retention
4. Adapts to changing market conditions

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.8+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Usage

### Training a Pricing Agent

```python
from ppo_dynamic_pricing import train_ppo_agent

# Train a new agent
agent, rewards = train_ppo_agent()

# Save the trained model
agent.save("my_pricing_model.pth")
```

### Evaluating Performance

```python
from ppo_dynamic_pricing import PPO, evaluate_ppo_agent

# Create agent and load trained model
state_dim = 12  # Depends on environment configuration
action_dim = 1
agent = PPO(state_dim, action_dim)
agent.load("my_pricing_model.pth")

# Evaluate agent performance
profits = evaluate_ppo_agent(agent, num_episodes=10, visualize=True)
```

## Extensions

This implementation can be extended in several ways:

1. Integration with real sales data
2. Multi-product pricing with inventory constraints
3. Competitor response modeling
4. Long-term customer loyalty effects
5. Discount and promotion optimization
